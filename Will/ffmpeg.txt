These commands were used with varying degrees of success to encode videos. Sometimes they work and other times not, but usually at least one method will work.

Replace (even number) with the width? height? of the frame. Also try swapping around the : if that doesn't work.
ffmpeg -i frame_fireLine_%03d.png -vf scale=(even number):-2 fire.mp4

Let a GUI tool (HandBrake) do the hard work
ffmpeg -i frame_fireLine_%03d.png -c:v png fire.avi
then encode using handbrake

Use this if 4 digit number
ffmpeg -i frame_fireLine_%04d.png -vf scale=(even number):-2 fire.mp4
